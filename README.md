# Holberton AirBnB Clone - The Console
This is the first part of a six part series of making a simple copy of the AirBnB website. This project will be completed over four months as part of our second trimester for Holberton Tulsa. Below we will have more of a description of the project and examples of how to use our console.

## How to open our console
The console can be use in interactive or non-interactive mode. 
By entering `./console.py` in the terminal a prompt will open up where the user can enter various commands to be executed. 
### Interactive Mode:

### Non-Interactive Mode:

Exiting the console is as easy as Ctrl+D or the `EOF` command.

<h3>Console.py examples:</h3>
<p>
**WARNING:** Since BaseModel classes have their instance ids instantiated via uuid4() (universally unique identifier) 
there's almost no chance that the instance(s) you generate locally will have the same id(s) as the following tutorial.

First run the console from the repo's base directory with:
```
./console.py
```
After this a (hbnb) prompt should be printed to standard out, and the command loop started.

Now you can use the built-in console functionality! To show all instances of State for example, you could use:
```
all State
```
but alas, there might not be any states prepopulated, but that's okay since youc an make one with...
```
create State
```
after which the instance ID of your newly created State should be printed to standard out. repeating this 
a few times then re-running the
```all State``` command should produce a list of all the state instances!

Now try updating the name of a state instance with... update!
```
update State 16360b87-6657-45dc-acbd-d3628c322493 name "Oklahoma"
```
and let's also give the other example states names...
```
update State f8377c68-8c8e-4a8d-887e-c575639f7cba name "Texas"
update State bd4d4249-b710-4d6a-b197-4919f77c4145 name "Colorado"
```
but what if we one day decide Texas sucks? well we can delete it like this:
```
destroy State f8377c68-8c8e-4a8d-887e-c575639f7cba
```
now if we try
```
show State f8377c68-8c8e-4a8d-887e-c575639f7cba
```
we'll see the "** no instance found **" error message!
we can confirm the good states still exist with a quick
```
all State
```
then exit the console with the built in quit:
```
quit
```

<h3>Console.py Interactive Exit Conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li>1. It receives a SIGTERM (Ctrl + D) EOF signal, causing a controlled shutdown</li>
<li>2. It receives a SIGKILL signal, whereafter undefined behavior may transpire</li>
<li>3. The built-in exit method 'quit' is used, also causing a controlled exit</li>
<li>4. A fatal program error occurs, and is most likely printed to stderr</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unit Testing:</h3>
<p>
Included test modules exist in the project's 'tests' directory and are discoverable with command:

```
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

To-Do/WIP ... currently console.py does not have any associated automatable testing.
